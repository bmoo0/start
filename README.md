## My own custom startpage forked from from this awesome original by [@pschfr](https://www.github.com/pschfr/start)

##Features:
- Background image randomizes on page load, from [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/) which pulls from [this collection](https://unsplash.com/collections/292287/)
- Weather is from [monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather](https://github.com/monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather)
- Keyboard navigation is thanks to [ccampbell/mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap)!
- Random inspirational quote!
- Most recently listened to song thanks to my Last.FM script [pschfr/LastFM.js](https://github.com/pschfr/LastFM.js)! This one I removed because I don't use Last.FM

Each category is openable by keyboard and click, press escape or click background to close all.

##You need extensions for most browsers to use this as your new tab page:
- [New Tab Redirect for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)
	- You can also go to chrome://extensions, tick Developer Mode, and Load as unpacked extension for faster loading.
- [New Tab Override for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
- [Custom New Tab Page for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/custom-new-tab-page/)
- Safari - just set it as your homepage in settings.

Browse similar style pages on [/r/startpages](https://reddit.com/r/startpages).

BTW, it's super fast. Fully loaded at ~300ms (~150ms as an extension!!) :D
